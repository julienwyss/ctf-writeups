## Description
Shall pass this childish brainrot and get the flag!

```
Bats are flippy, flappy cool, 
I love to learn about bats at school!

## Solution
I opened the file in Audacity and saw something that looked off on the lower lane in the spectrogram. I thought it might be a flag, so I tried to zoom in on it and see if I could make it out. At first I was not able to read all the letters, but I could see that it was a flag.

I then tried to use Sonic Visualiser to see if I could get a better view of the flag.

After some tweaking, I was able to see the flag in the spectrogram more clearly.

The flag is: `BtSCTF{I_am_batman_I_can_hear_it}`
