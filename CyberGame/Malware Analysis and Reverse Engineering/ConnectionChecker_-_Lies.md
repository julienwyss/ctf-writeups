## Solution

Adjusted the code so it ignores the hash check and debuged the program. By looking at the 'encodedData' variable I was able to find the flag. When printing the variable I got a Base64 encoded string in the console:

![Console](images/Screenshot_216.png)

By decoding the Base64 string I got the following output:

```
dfef15cf0e01909f75dd1647d0b993a3|SK-CERT{k3y_f0r_c253rv3r}
```

The flag is SK-CERT{k3y_f0r_c253rv3r}.
